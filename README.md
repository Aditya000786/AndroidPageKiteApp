# Android PageKite App #

This is an Android PageKite app.

This code is a work in progress.


## What is PageKite? ##

PageKite is a protocol for dynamic, tunneled reverse proxying of arbitrary
TCP byte streams.  It is particularly well suited for making a HTTP server
on a device without a public IP address visible to the wider Internet, but
can also be used for a variety of other things, including SSH access.
