### Why? ###

The intent of the above alternate license clause, is to allow developers of
proprietary software (including Android apps) to use libpagekite as part of
their products, as long as they EITHER support the upstream PageKite project
OR respect their users' freedom enough not to obfuscate the connection
settings or lock them in to one specific service provider.

bulk discounts, support contracts or have questions about compliance are
encouraged to get in touch with the authors.
